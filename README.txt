TITLE: Customer Records and Scheduling Appointments Database
PURPOSE: The purpose of this application is to assist an organization with a GUI-based scheduling desktop application.
The application will be able to update, add, and delete customer records and appointments.
The organization does business in multiple languages and in different locations in the United Staes, Candada, and
the United Kingdom. The program can adjust the application appropriately by detecting the user's language based 
off of the set language of the desktop and it can also detect the time zone. The application will use the information off of
the MySQL database provided by the organization.
